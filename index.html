    <p>I love getting dressed up and expressing myself, having that freedom to be uniquely me. 
      Our festival crew plans out each day and we pick an overal theme.

      My favorite day was neon. I really went all out, with lime green fishnets, mesh gloves, feather jewelry, and face jewels.

    The scene
    </h2>
    <article>
   <p> North Coast really put together something special this year. Their stages were placed perfectly, allowing so much room for everyone to spread out, dance, vibe, while limiting any carryover sound from surrounding stages.
       That's hard to do, considering there were 3 artists playing at a time at each of the main stages, plus a few smaller stages hosting various lesser known artists. 
       The sound systems were top notch, the stage effects, the lasers and lights, and the nightime fireworks were phenomenal. And all the fun props, art exhibits and interactive spaces made for a lot of fun exploring.

    All about the music
    </h2>
    <article>
   <p> The real reason to go, of course, is the music. EDM has been a favorite of mine since as long as I can remember.
       The music speaks to my soul, moves my body, and has facilitated connections with some of the best people I've ever met.
       I got to check a couple big names off my bucket list this year: Zeds Dead, Ganja White Knight, Alison Wonderland, ATLiens, and Big Gigantic. Got to see some of my favorites as well, like Liquid Stranger and Black Tiger Sex Machine. Each day of the festival had a lineup that left nothing to be desired. I danced till my knees hurt and smiled till my face hurt. Shyness gets checked at the door when it comes to your dance moves. You move the way the music makes you feel and no one is there judging what that looks like.

Being able to enjoy this festival with my partner (it was our first together) and our best friends made this weekend in Chicago a truly magical experience. 
It is a beautiful thing to share that time with people who love you and who share the same love of this music and this life with you. I hope everyone get a chance to experience this at least once. It's lifechanging.
